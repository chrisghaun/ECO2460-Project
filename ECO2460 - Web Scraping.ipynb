Only in this country could a refugee from Venezuela who started in a basement Montreal apartment and the son of a teenage mother raised by school teachers make it to this stage, leading Canada’s founding political party. That is because of the promise this country makes to Canadians of every birthplace and background—that anyone from anywhere can achieve anything. That hard work gets you a great life, with a beautiful house, on a safe street, under our proud flag.',\n",
       " 'Ana et moi savons que nos histoires n’ont été possibles qu’ici, au Canada. C’est ici qu’une réfugiée du Venezuela, qui a commencé dans un appartement dans un sous-sol à Montréal, et le fils d’une mère adolescente, élevé par deux enseignants, ont pu arriver à ce stade, à la tête du parti politique fondateur du Canada. C’est grâce à la promesse que ce pays a fait a nous et à tous les Canadiens, de tous les lieux de naissance et de tous les milieux – que quiconque peut accomplir ses rêves. Le travaille acharné vous permettait de mener une vie formidable, avec une belle maison, dans un quartier sécuritaire, sous notre fier drapeau.',\n",
       " 'Ana and I are so grateful that this beautiful country made and kept that promise to us. And we are in this fight to restore that promise to every Canadian who has lost it over the last nine years. ',\n",
       " 'Conservatives, as the Party of Confederation and Sir John A. Macdonald, will restore the promise of Canada. Our founding party leader united our country from the Atlantic to the Pacific and warded off American designs to dominate our continent. In the words of our first Prime Minister, Conservatives will fight to “give us a great, a united, a rich, an improving, a developing Canada, instead of making us a tributary to American laws, to American railways, to American bondage, to American tolls”. That is the Conservative legacy for Canada.',\n",
       " 'Now more than ever, we owe this country, we love this country and we fight everyday and in every way to pass down to our kids the blessings we inherited from those who came before us. Simply put: we must all put Canada First.  \\n\\nAujourd’hui, plus que jamais, on est redevables à ce pays. On l’aime, et on se bat chaque jour pour transmettre à nos enfants les bienfaits qu’on a reçus de ceux qui nous ont précédés. L’idée est simple : on doit tous mettre le Canada d’abord.',\n",

',\n",

       " 'But we have more leverage: We will make sure Americans know that they will be paying the tariffs they impose on us. Refinery workers, homebuilders, automakers and others need to know that their jobs depend on buying our goods–and that tariffing those goods will lower their wages. ',\n",
       " 'It doesn’t stop there—America cannot power its energy-hungry future without buying our surplus power. Google, Amazon, Microsoft and Meta are all turning to nuclear power to run their AI data centres. We have the nuclear, natural gas and hydro that can power those centers here with cold weather that reduces the cost of cooling them. Let’s leverage that. ',\n",
       " 'America needs our radar, surveillance and ongoing cooperation to keep us both safe against intercontinental missiles and other threats. They need our minerals, uranium, oil and gas.',\n",

       " 'Winston Churchill has been quoted saying you can count on Americans doing the right thing, after exhausting all other possibilities.',\n",
       " 'So let me spell out the options for our American friends: ',\n",
       " 'Option 1: You carry out an unprovoked attack on our economy. Your consumers pay more, and your workers make less. Gas prices skyrocket. You turn a loyal friend into a resentful neighbour forced to match tariff with tariff and to seek friends everywhere else. Both our countries’ economies will weaken, leaving less money for defence and security. And our enemies will grow stronger.  ',\n",
       " 'OR',\n",
       " 'Option 2: We trade even more than we are now. Both our workers make more, and consumers pay less. The resulting GDP boost allows Canada to further strengthen the border and up our military spending to 2% of GDP; we stop fentanyl, terrorists, supersonic missiles and other threats. We team up against the unfair trading practices of other countries. Both our countries end up safer, stronger, richer.  ',\n",
       " 'Oh, and there is something else I’d like to say to our American friends: ',\n",
       " 'We’ve always loved you as neighbours and friends. There is no country with whom we would rather share a border—the longest undefended border in the world. We know America is the biggest economic and military superpower the world has ever known. ',\n",
       " 'We have been a good neighbour. We fought on the same side of the same wars. We paid with Canadian lives and treasure to fight for America, avenging the 9/11 attacks. You have your grievances, and we have ours. But I ask, which other country would you rather have as your neighbour? If Canada is not your friend, who is? ',\n",
       " 'See, the problem is, at times, we might be too polite, soft-spoken and humble for our own good. We are slow to anger and quick to forgive, but never confuse our kindness with weakness. We love our country and flag. We are a strong people with a proud history as a warrior nation, whose soldiers have proven fierce enough to crush the fascists, the communists and Al-Qaeda, yet humble enough to never once brag about their heroism. We are mild-mannered and made of steel. ',\n",
       " 'Let me be clear: We will never be the 51st state. We will bear any burden and pay any price to protect our sovereignty and independence. ',\n",
       " 'Permettez-moi donc d’énoncer clairement les options qui s’offrent à nos amis américains : ',\n",
       " 'Option 1 : Vous lancez une attaque non-provoquée contre notre économie. Vos consommateurs paient plus et vos travailleurs gagnent moins. Les prix de l’essence augmentent. Vous transformez un allié fidèle en un voisin amère, obligé d’imposer des contre-tarifs et de chercher des alliés ailleurs. Les économies des deux pays s’affaiblissent, laissant moins d’argent pour la défense et la sécurité. Nos ennemis en profitent. ',\n",
       " 'OU',\n",
       " 'Option 2 : On commerce encore plus qu’aujourd’hui. Nos travailleurs gagnent plus et les consommateurs paient moins. L’augmentation du PIB qui en résulte permet au Canada de renforcer encore plus la frontière et d’augmenter nos dépenses militaires à 2 % du PIB ; on va stopper le fentanyl, les terroristes, les missiles supersoniques et d’autres menaces. On fait équipe contre les pratiques commerciales déloyales des autres pays. Nos deux pays finissent par être plus sécuritaires, plus forts et plus riches.  ',\n",
       " 'Oh, et il y a autre chose que j’aimerais dire à nos amis américains : ',\n",
       " 'On vous a toujours aimés en tant que voisins et amis. Il n’y a aucun autre pays avec lequel on préférerait partager une frontière, la plus longue non-défendue au monde. On sait que les États-Unis sont la plus grande superpuissance économique et militaire de l’histoire. ',\n",
       " 'Vous avez vos griefs, et on a les nôtres. Mais je vous pose la question : quel autre pays préféreriez-vous avoir pour voisin ? Si le Canada n’est pas votre ami, qui l’est ? ',\n",
       " 'Voyez-vous, le problème c’est qu’on est parfois trop polis, trop doux et trop humbles. On est lents à nous fâcher et rapides à pardonner. Mais ne confondez jamais notre gentillesse avec de la faiblesse. On aime notre pays et notre drapeau. On est un peuple fort et fier de son histoire. Donc soyons clairs : nous ne serons jamais un État américain. On va assumer tout fardeau et on va payer le prix nécessaire pour protéger notre souveraineté et notre indépendance.',\n",
       " 'Which option Americans choose will be up to them. But we must be prepared for the worst. Simply put, we cannot no longer depend on the Americans alone for trade and defence.  ',\n",
       " 'These threats are a wake-up call. ',\n",
       " 'We should be the wealthiest and most self-reliant economy in the world today, given our natural riches. We have the 4th biggest supply of oil—yet we must import 179 million barrels of foreign oil every year because of the Liberal No-New Pipelines Act. We are the 5th biggest supplier of Natural Gas—but we still can’t export a single cubic meter of it overseas because Carney-Trudeau Liberals say there is no “business case” for LNG export plants. We have the fewest homes per person in the G7 even as we have ten times as much land to build on as the next biggest country, because taxes and bureaucracy block homebuilding, leaving our youth without houses. We sell twice as much to the U.S. as we sell to other provinces because of the trade barriers we impose on ourselves. We have the 3rd most farmland per capita in the world, yet food prices have risen 37% faster in Canada than in the U.S. because of the Trudeau-Carney Carbon Tax on the farmers and truckers who feed us. ',\n",
       " 'What have the Carney-Trudeau Liberals done about this: they have doubled the debt, doubled housing costs, doubled food bank line ups; blocked Canadian energy in favour of dirty dictator oil, raised taxes on work and investment and driven an astonishing half-trillion dollars of investment out of Canada to the U.S. All of this before the tariffs!\\n\\nThe reality is the opposite: If Carney-Trudeau policies caused this much economic harm BEFORE the tariffs, imagine the devastation they would cause AFTER tariffs.',\n",
       " 'We need a Prime Minister who will put Canada First—our workers, our businesses, our economy, our borders, our military. And we must be able to stand on our own two feet, no longer helplessly dependent on the Americans. ',\n",
       " 'The media says I should change my plans because of this tariff threat. ',\n",
       " 'In fact, the Trump tariff threats have proven Conservatives right on everything. Everyone now admits, or claims to admit, we were right on the Liberal capital gains tax hike, the carbon tax, pipelines, LNG, fentanyl, the borders, immigration and the need to celebrate rather than cancel our history and our country.\\n\\nQu’ont fait les libéraux de Carney et Trudeau ? Ils ont doublé la dette, doublé les coûts du logement, doublé l’usage des banques alimentaires, bloqué l’énergie canadienne au profit du pétrole des dictateurs, augmenté les taxes sur le travail et l’investissement, et fait fuir un montant stupéfiant d’un demi-billion de dollars d’investissements du Canada vers les États-Unis. Tout ça avant les tarifs douaniers ! ',\n",
       " 'Ils veulent maintenant instrumentaliser les tarifs pour faire oublier leurs échecs. Mais si les politiques libérales de Trudeau et de Carney ont causé autant de dommages économiques AVANT les tarifs, imaginez les ravages qu’ils vont causer APRÈS. ',\n",

       " 'Les médias disent que je devrais changer ma plateforme à cause de cette menace de tarifs douaniers.',\n",
       " 'En fait, les menaces de Trump sur les tarifs ont donné raison aux conservateurs sur tous les points. Tout le monde admet maintenant, ou prétend admettre, qu’on avait raison sur la hausse de la taxe sur les gains en capital des libéraux, la taxe carbone, les pipelines, le GNL, le fentanyl, les frontières, l’immigration et la nécessité de célébrer plutôt que d’annuler notre histoire et notre pays.',\n",
       " 'First, the Liberals said I had no policies. Then they said my policies were scary. Now they pretend dishonestly to agree with all my policies, 60 days before an election. I take it as a compliment, but don’t believe them for a minute. If you want Conservative policies, you must vote Conservative to get them. ',\n",
       " 'Take the carbon tax. Before the threat of tariffs, the carbon tax was the issue of the election. Now, I have to concede…it is an even bigger issue: combining Trump’s tariffs with Carney’s carbon tax will decimate our industries and destroy the jobs of our workers. ',\n",
       " 'The worst Liberal tax of all has been the carbon tax, championed by Justin Trudeau and his economic advisor, Mark Carney, whose only complaint was that the tax was not high enough. Now, he plans a pre-election trick. Next month, just days before the election, and after years of pushing the tax—he will pause it. The media will tell you to forget all about it until after the election when he will massively raise the tax, only this time with no rebate. ',\n",
       " 'He said just a few days ago he doesn’t want to “axe the tax” he wants to QUOTE “change” the tax. Right, he will take the CHANGE right out of your pocket. ',\n",

Our industrial towns will become ghost towns if Carney gets his way.\\n\\nLa nouvelle taxe carbone plus élevée de Mark Carney va aider les États-Unis à prendre tous les emplois industriels du Canada. Nos villes industrielles deviendront des villes fantômes si Carney parvient à ses fins. Et OUI, sa nouvelle taxe carbone va s’appliquer au Québec. Au-delà des taxes déjà en place.',\n",
       " 'The coming election will decide whether Canadians want Mark Carney’s sneaky, job-killing, inflationary carbon tax or whether they want to axe the tax for everyone, for real, forever with the Common-Sense Conservatives.',\n",
       " 'Mark Carney will plagiarize all my policies right before the election–policies he has long opposed. But don’t believe a word. Just a few months ago, Mark Carney moved his company headquarters OUT OF CANADA to Donald Trump’s hometown of New York, shifting jobs and investment to the U.S., just like Trump wanted. He opposed pipelines in Canada while his company bought them in the Middle East. He supported Trudeau’s carbon taxes in Canada, while his company invested in and profited off coal in the U.S. He put his profit before our people. Carney cashed in. Canadians lost out. If he wins, Canada loses.',\n",
       " 'What we need is a Bring it Home Economic Plan',\n",
       " 'We need to bring home our jobs, investment and companies and break our dependence on the United States.

In 9 years, the Carney-Trudeau Liberals have pushed  a half trillion more Canadian investment dollars to the US than have returned to Canada—that is Canadian money building American businesses and creating American jobs. ',\n",
       " 'Much of it is in the energy sector. They passed the “No-New-Pipelines” Law C-69, and killed Energy East, Northern Gateway and countless other projects. ',\n",
       " 'So we can’t deliver our energy to the world without going through the States. In fact it’s much worse than that, we cannot deliver our oil to ourselves. Western oil must travel through the United States to get to Quebec. The Americans have even threatened to shut down the flow of Canadian oil to Canadian customers. ',\n",
       " 'Mr. Trudeau—with his Economic Advisor Mark Carney—said there is no business case for selling our natural gas to countries like Germany, Japan, Greece, and others who were begging for it. Now the Americans and Qataris are beating us to the punch. So, we sell all our natural gas exports to the Americans at roughly $4 per million British thermal units, instead of selling it to Europe for $13. Again, simple math. When you can take something that is $4 and sell it for $13 that is a business case. ',\n",

It would take food off grocery shelves, take parts out of factories and shut down the farm vehicles that bring us our food.

I worked with former prime minister Harper to help balance the budget and rebuild the military so that we would have necessary equipment to help destroy al Qaeda after the attacks of 9/11.

Now Carney says he does not even want the job of finance minister. He does not even want to try to drive the crashed-out bus after he helped run it off the cliff. The Liberals could not find anyone all day. In fact, no one will appear today to defend this incredible disaster of a budget.',\n",
       " '    We can look at the consequences in human terms: We have 1,400 homeless camps in Ontario and 35 homeless encampments in Halifax alone. Two million people are lined up at food banks. Scurvy is making a comeback. The government admits that one in four children is going to school hungry every single day. Unemployment is rising and, according to the budget, expected to exceed 7% by the end of next calendar year. The gap between per capita GDP in Canada and the U.S. is now 30,000 Canadian dollars, although it was equal 10 years ago. This is the worst gap since at least the Second World War, and some say it is the worst gap in a century.',\n",
       " '    Canadian workers are only getting 55¢ of investment for every dollar an American worker gets. A half a trillion Canadian investment dollars, which works out to almost a quarter of our economy, has left, net. It has gone to the United States to build pipelines, factories, warehouses and business centres; Canadian investment dollars are paying American wages while our workers go starving for investment and for salaries to pay their bills.',\n",
       " \"    When I travel across this country, I consistently meet two types of people. There are those who are a little better off. I will be very blunt about this. They tell me that if I do not win, they will leave the country. They are very numerous. I do not worry about them as much. Do members know whom I worry about? I worry about the ones who cannot leave. Using very blunt language, they are the ones who tell me, “I don't know what the hell I'm going to do. I have no idea how I'm going to pay my way.”\",\n",
       " '     I met a waitress at a restaurant not long ago. She came up to me, grabbed me by the hand and said that I have to win. I thanked her and said that I appreciated her support. She said, no, it was not a compliment. Then she told me her story. She was working one full-time job and two part-time jobs just to pay her bills. This is a single woman in her late fifties, and she was tired of working all the time. She had cut everything out of her budget, every creature comfort and everything she enjoyed about her life, so that she could drop one of those part-time jobs. One morning, she woke up, walked outside and her car was gone. She called her insurance, and they said they were not going to cover the replacement value. She had to take that job back because she simply cannot live her life without a car.',\n",
       " \"     Colleagues can bet their bottom dollar that the guy who stole the car was probably out on bail. This was not his first job. This woman's taxes and heating bill have gone up. Her wages have not gone up. She is scared to go out in the streets, in places where they did not even lock the door not long ago. These are the people we are fighting for.\",\n",
       " '    These silly games over here are very entertaining, as is the soap opera that everyone is seized with today. That is all fine, but there are real people whose lives are on the line. We have a duty to work for them.',\n",
       " '    Quite frankly, this woman does not see me or any of us as any kind of saviour. They see us all as a last hope. In fact, she does not want to be saved; she just wants her life back. She was taking care of herself just fine before her tax, her heat and her grocery bill went through the roof and her car went missing. She was doing everything right.',\n",
       " '    I met a guy at the Labatt brewery a few days ago, and members can watch the video of me talking with him. He walked up to me and said he works three jobs, but his family cannot make it. They are renting. They have no hope. They have given up on ever owning a home. They can barely make it. He said to me that he feels ashamed when he talks to his kids because they ask why he is never around and why they can never have a house. He feels like a failure.',\n",
       " '    He did not fail. He has been failed. He has been robbed of the promise of Canada. It was a very simple promise: If we worked hard, we got a good life. It was not fancy or extravagant, but we got a house with a yard, where we could have kids playing safely. We could have a nice dog that we could afford to feed, along with the kids. Our kids could play safely in the streets. That was the promise.',\n",
       " '    Politicians break promises all the time, but do we know what was bad about this promise? This promise did not belong to the Prime Minister. It was not his promise to break. It belonged to all of us. Our purpose is to bring home that promise for that young man, that young father, and that older female worker, so that they can take back control of their lives once again and live in a safe country where their hard work earns them a good wage, where the rent and food are affordable and where, when they go to bed at night, they know that they will be safe throughout their sleep and that they will have their car in their driveway in the morning. Our purpose is to have a country where people are proud to fly the flag again, where they know that the government is a servant and not a master and where they understand that the Commons, this place, works for the common people every day, not for the ego of one man desperate to cling to his job.',\n",
       " '    We must remember that we are servants in this place. We have a job to do on behalf of the people who sent us here. Our personal dramas are not important. The dramas that should seize all of our concern and imagination are the daily dramas of the working women and men who build this country. We are in it for them. We are going to give them control of their lives back in the freest country on earth, Canada. Let us bring it home.',\n",
       " \"Hon. Pierre Poilievre:  \\n     Mr. Speaker, absolutely everything is broken today, and 70-plus per cent of Canadians agree with me on that. The borders are broken. There are half a million people here illegally, according to the government's own documents. The immigration system is broken. We now have refugee camps, something we only used to see in third world countries. They are being set up across our country in formerly tranquil and peaceful suburbs. The drugs and disorder have broken our communities. We have lost more people to drug overdoses in the last nine years than died fighting for Canada in the Second World War.\",\n",

       " 'Hon. Pierre Poilievre:  \\n    Mr. Speaker, the member wants me to tell the truth about the permanent tax change. There is a permanent tax change he has supported, which is to jack up the carbon tax on absolutely everything. He has voted to quadruple that tax to an eyewatering 61¢ a litre that would literally grind our economy to a halt. It would take food off grocery shelves, take parts out of factories and shut down the farm vehicles that bring us our food. It would be a nuclear winter if the tax increase that he has voted to legislate into place ever happens. That is why we need a carbon tax election: so that I can axe the tax.',\n",
       " 'Hon. Pierre Poilievre:  \\n    I would be happy to talk about jobs, Mr. Speaker. My first job here was to help pass the Federal Accountability Act to crack down on the corruption that we have seen on the Liberal side. I then helped cut the GST so that Canadians could save when they made every single consumer purchase; it was cut from 7% to 6% to 5%. I worked with former prime minister Harper to help balance the budget and rebuild the military so that we would have necessary equipment to help destroy al Qaeda after the attacks of 9/11. I helped deliver the lowest inflation of any government in 40 years, leaving behind a balanced budget and the best balance sheet of any government in the G7.',\n",

       " 'Hon. Pierre Poilievre:  \\n    Mr. Speaker, it is such a tough question; I almost did not want to stand up and answer it for a second there. It is a big mess. It is an incredible mess the Prime Minister will leave behind when he takes a run, and I understand that might happen any minute, as carbon tax Carney is lining up. We almost wonder if carbon tax Carney planned it all this way. He is the top economic adviser. He pushed all of these extra spending measures on the former finance minister and then she objected to the crazy $62-billion deficit. She is out now. The Prime Minister might soon be out. Who will walk up? Well, carbon tax Carney will, taking the wheel of the bus after he helped crash it.',\n",
       " '    He not the only one. There is also the getaway car. Who has been driving the getaway car? It is the NDP leader. Today, he said the Prime Minister should resign. However, just days ago he voted to keep the Prime Minister exactly where he is. It is time for the NDP leader to state clearly that not only has he lost confidence in the Prime Minister, but he is prepared to vote non-confidence or take any other legal steps necessary to to express non-confidence in the Prime Minister in order to trigger a carbon tax election as soon as possible.']"
